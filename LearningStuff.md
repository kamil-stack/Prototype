### Javascript Resources
- Callback Functions [Link](https://codeburst.io/javascript-what-the-heck-is-a-callback-aba4da2deced)
  - A callback function is a function in which is executed after one has finished exectuing so this could be used for updating something after an event has happened. This is useful because if a function requires some time to be executed the callback function will execute only after the first function has been completed therefore this is useful in creating web applications.
